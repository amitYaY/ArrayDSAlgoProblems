3.	How do you find the largest and smallest number in an unsorted integer array?
4.	How do you remove duplicates from an array in place?
5.	How do you reverse an array in place in Java?
6.	How do you find all pairs of an integer array whose sum is equal to a given number?
7.	How do you find duplicate numbers in an array if it contains multiple duplicates?

9.  Given an integer array arr, and an integer target, return the number of tuples i, j, k such that i < j < k and arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k] == target. As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
11. Given a binary array nums, return the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.
12. Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's, and return the matrix.
13. Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence of that array such that for every two consecutive integers in the subsequence, nums[i] and nums[j], where i < j, the condition j - i <= k is satisfied. A subsequence of an array is obtained by deleting some number of elements (can be zero) from the array, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.
